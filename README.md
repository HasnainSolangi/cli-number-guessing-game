# cli-number-guessing-game
𝓐𝓵𝓱𝓪𝓶𝓭𝓾𝓵𝓲𝓵𝓵𝓪𝓱! I've successfully completed the CLI Number Guessing Game project!

In this project, I've created a simple yet engaging game where users guess a number between 1 and 10.



Here's a more detailed breakdown of the project:



𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Firstly, I cloned the git repository associated with the project using the appropriate git command.

𝗜𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Furthermore, I initiated TypeScript in the project directory using the command tsc --init.

𝗣𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Then, I initialized a new npm package using the command npm init. This prompted me to provide information about the project such as name, version, description, etc.

𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: I proceeded to install the 'inquirer' package as a dependency using the command npm install inquirer. This package facilitates user input through the command line interface.

Package Type: 'inquirer' is an interactive command line user interface module for Node.js.

𝗡𝗣𝗠 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻: Following that, I logged in to my npm account using the command npm login. This prompted me to enter my npm username, password, and email.

𝗡𝗣𝗠 𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴: Finally, once logged in, I published my package on npm using the command npm publish. This made my CLI Number Guessing Game project available for others to install and use via npm.
